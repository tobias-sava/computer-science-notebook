Queues - 05/01/2025

A queue is a linear data structure that simulates sequential processing
through two fundamental operations:

- Enqueue - add an element to the back of the queue
- Dequeue - remove an element from the front of the queue

Like a real world queue, you line up at the back of the queue and get served at the front.

Example: Enqueue = Lining up at the back of the queue
Example: Dequeue = Getting served at the front of the queue


When and where are queues used?

- Used in web servers to handle requests in order of arrival

- Managing print job scheduling in printers

- Used in operating systems for handling process scheduling

- Breadth-first search (BFS) implementations in graph algorithms

- Handling asynchronous data transfer (buffering) between processes

- Managing callback queues in event-driven programming

- Implementing caches with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) policy

- Managing task scheduling in real-time systems

Complexity

Enqueue: O(1)    // Adding to back of queue
Dequeue: O(1)    // Removing from front of queue
Peek: O(1)       // Looking at front element
Contains: O(n)   // Searching through queue
Length: O(1)     // Getting size of queue
IsEmpty: O(1)    // Checking if queue is empty
Clear: O(1)      // Removing all elements

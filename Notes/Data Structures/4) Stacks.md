Stacks - 02/01/2025

A stack is a one-ended liner data structure which models a real world
stack by having two primary operations, namely push and pop.

When and where are stacks used?

1) Used by undo mechanisms in text editors.

2) Used in compiler syntax checking for matching brackets and braces.

3) Can be used to model a pile of books or plates.

4) Used behind the scenes to support recursion by keeping track of
previous function calls.

5) Can be used to do a Depth First Search (DFS) on a graph.
    - Can be done manually.
    - Can be done using recursion.



Note: Watch out for memory leaks in lower level languages, memory must be managed with
every action. This goes for every data structure of course.

Example: .pop()'ing a stack.

Rest done on paper, this structure was quite easy to understand and replicate.
